# Types of Design:

## User Interface Design:
* Deals in signifiers and signified.
* Touch interactions, "natural scrolling" from Apple.
* signifiers show what available interactions there are.
   * i.e. peek of a hidden element
* windows phone panorama menu
* ![panorama menu](http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/stephanc/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsPhone7PanoramaControl_FF66/panorama-ctrl_3.jpg)
* read the HIG!
* System standards UI elements = UI Elements.
  * Alert menus are so familiar that they're basically system 1.


## Information Architecture
* create a flow diagram/map with pages and decisions

## Interaction Design
* Different than UI because it deals with motion and movement.

## User Experience Design
* Understanding flows and understanding how people behave through these flows.
* Huge gap between behaviors and opinions.
* John Maeda quote: "Great art makes you wonder; great designs make things clear."

# UX & Usability

## Background
Example- you don't have a hammer so you use a wrench instead. The wrench is a utility, but it's usability as a hammer is not great.

Desirability has to do with how well it works.

Then branding indicates to you that it's desirable.

Personal story: uses Twitter as a bookmarking service. Not what it's meant for. Not that usable, utility is not good. It is good at social interactions. 

## Natural User Interface vs Graphical interface
Natural user interface has to come in gradually. *Skeumorphism* - using the design patterns of an older medium in a new medium. So iBooks looked like books and Grandma knew how to use them.

* iOS 6 tab management. Dismiss by pressing a big X. In iOS 7 you can swipe horizontally to move things out of the way. In iOS 6 you would swipe horizontally to move through. You cannot swipe to dismiss.
* New pattern in iOS: swipe left to delete.

* example: Clear App. Completely gestural manipulation. 

* HIG for iOS and Android: use direct manipulation! 

* Learnability of interfaces. 

* Buttons vs gestures. Josh Clarke [@globalmoxie](http://twitter.com/globalmoxie): *Buttons are a Hack*
* But buttons can be more clear.
* Some buttons are gestures (toggles, sliders).
* carousel dots, tell you how many things there are and that you can swipe
