# Memorability

## Do you repeat walk throughs or tips?

## How many steps do you take?
* i.e. save an album for offline listening on Spotify
* user-flow pages and decisions: 27 steps, but not an uncommon interaction

## Recall vs Recognition
* Structure helps
* Reverse chronological

## Introducing new patterns

## Back Buttons
* Arrow shows that it's going back
* You should label it with what it goes back to
* Can include other info as well (like inbox count)

## Animating Form
* Square wallet.
* When I enter fields they turn into labels and I am advanced to the next field via an animation.

CEO was getting complaints about how slow everything was. Hiring more baggage handlers was not helping.
