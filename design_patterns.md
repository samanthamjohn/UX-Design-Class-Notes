# Design Patterns

## Skeumorphism
* Teach natural design principles

## Platform Agnostic
* Advantage: design once and deploy to multiple platforms
* Facebook side panel
* Fade and carousels on WSJ live
* Haze weather app

## Platform Specific
* Advantage: users look at it, understand it as familiar UI and now how to use it.
* New York Times/Sound Cloud - have different designs on different platforms
* Follow the HIG for specific platform

## Responsive Design
* Looks different depending on screen size.
* Use web technologies to develop once and deploy to multiple platforms.
* e.g. [Boston Globe](http://www.bostonglobe.com)
* design and interaction might change based on screen size.
* grid layout.
### Three things to consider
  * scale and optional nature of elements in a module
  * interactivity that it should have (hover vs. not)
  * content strategy- rearrange things on the page.
