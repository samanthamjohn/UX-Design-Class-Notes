# Usability

## Lemers- Jacob Nielsen

## Learnability
* How essential is your app.
* How many features do you have?

## Launch Experience
* dialog- need to worry a lot about timing
* tips- custom UI. Can get in the way, have too many.
* walk-thru/tour. Like an instruction manual, this can be crappy. Upfront info where you're not using the product
* demo video- can be as small as a gif showing someone interacting with your app
* embedded tips
* transparency
* persistent tips
* discoverable


## Video Games

### Mario
* Gumba runs into you until you learn to jump.
#### Deadspace
* hand with up and down
